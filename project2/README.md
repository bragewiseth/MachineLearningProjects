## Here you will find additional calculations, results and code to reproduce these results

### Steps to reproduce


> The code lives in `src/`, datafiles lives in `data/`, results lives in `runsAndAdditions/` and the bulidfiles for the report lives in `report/`




The synthetic data is generated by `generateData.py` using `np.random.seed(9282)` for consistent data generation. You do not need to regenerate data to
reproduce our results, as `data/` contains the necesary files.


You simply need to run on of the python files you are interested in, and you should get our exact results. You may need to comment in/out some code blocks depending on
what you want to be output
